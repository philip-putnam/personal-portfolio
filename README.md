# Philip Putnam

This project will be a new test bed for my personal portfolio site, which I hope to deploy using Google Firebase

## Instructions

I hope to have this site deployed at https://www.philip-putnam.com until then you can clone this repository locally with the following directions:

1. Copy the URL of this page above or click on the "Clone or download" toward the top and right of this page
2. After copying the URL, navigate to where you would like to place the project in a command line terminal
3. Type: git clone https://github.com/philip-putnam/personal-portfolio
4. In the command line terminal navigate inside the folder that is downloaded, i.e. angular2-portfolio, type: npm install
5. type: bower install
6. type: ng serve or ng s
7. In your preferred compatible browser, navigate to localhost:4200
